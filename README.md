PH235_HW: Project sets at for Physics Elective
=========================================

## Description
This is a course projects sets collection for Physics Elective at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art. 
Most of the Problems were selected from the textbook [Computational Physics authored by Mark Newman](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/).
***
The scope ranged from making scientific graphics, including graphs, density plots, and 3D visualizations of physical systems. 
Also, estimation for the accuracy of our calculations and the time the calculation will take with a general Computer Clock speed concern
[Time and space Complexity].Then, methods for performing integrals and derivatives on the computer, including basic techniques like the trapezoidal rule and Simpson's rule, and more advanced techniques like adaptive methods, Romberg integration, and Gaussian quadrature
were explored. And later linear and nonlinear systems of equations, the solution of ordinary and partial differential equations, Fourier transforms, stochastic processes, and Monte Carlo methods were discussed.
