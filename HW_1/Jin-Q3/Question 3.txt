First set up the sun at the origin
Then bring in all the radius,  Orbit , Period and self-designed color scheme as seperate lists. 

Create a empty array of type sphere as suggested and use a for to set up their initial configuarations.

Use another for loop to set them into move by use x=Acos(wt) y=Asin(wt)
Figure put the scaling factor to make the animation clear.
