Question 1

   For question 1, number a a is simply put in constants, ask for A and Z then do if else clause  to determine a5, then compute B.

   for number b , just change output from B to B/A.

   for number c, the key is to record Ba max in the for loop. thus I campare Ba with a Bamax, if larger than replace Bamax with Ba's value.

   number d is just to add another bigger loop about z around the loop to record Zmax with the same method mentioned above.
