Question2

Basically follow the instruction 
create a list of prime numbers 
check the new number if it can be divide by the prime numbers in the list up to sqrt(n)
Thus, use if break can satisfy this idea.

Then , to avoid multiple addtion of the new prime number in the list use boolean to suggeest the isPrime(true or false) relationship  and finnaly bring out the whole list.
