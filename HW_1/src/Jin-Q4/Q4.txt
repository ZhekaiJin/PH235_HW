Q4 

Because the iteration will be used multiple times, firstly define it as a function as to iterate n times with r and intial x

then in r's for loop 
first run iteration 10001 times, and set the last value into a list.
creat a corresponding r list in match to the previous list.
then do the iteration one by one using a while loop and each tme add x and r to their list. then plot for each r value.

Finally image can be gotten.
